    @classmethod
    def from_pretrained(cls, pretrained_model_name_or_path, *model_args, **kwargs):
        r"""Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using ``model.eval()`` (Dropout modules are deactivated)
        To train the model, you should first set it back in training mode with ``model.train()``

        The warning ``Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model`` means that the weights of XXX do not come pre-trained with the rest of the model.
        It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning task.

        The warning ``Weights from XXX not used in YYY`` means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path: either:

                - a string with the `shortcut name` of a pre-trained model to load from cache or download, e.g.: ``bert-base-uncased``.
                - a path to a `directory` containing model weights saved using :func:`~pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`, e.g.: ``./my_model_directory/``.
                - a path or url to a `tensorflow index checkpoint file` (e.g. `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In this case, ``from_tf`` should be set to True and a configuration object should be provided as ``config`` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.

            model_args: (`optional`) Sequence of positional arguments:
                All remaning positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method

            config: (`optional`) instance of a class derived from :class:`~pytorch_transformers.PretrainedConfig`:
                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuation. Configuration can be automatically loaded when:

                - the model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the ``shortcut-name`` string of a pretrained model), or
                - the model was saved using :func:`~pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained` and is reloaded by suppling the save directory.
                - the model is loaded by suppling a local directory as ``pretrained_model_name_or_path`` and a configuration JSON file named `config.json` is found in the directory.

            state_dict: (`optional`) dict:
                an optional state dictionnary for the model to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.
                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own weights.
                In this case though, you should check if using :func:`~pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained` and :func:`~pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` is not a simpler option.

            cache_dir: (`optional`) string:
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pre-trained model
                configuration should be cached if the standard cache should not be used.

            force_download: (`optional`) boolean, default False:
                Force to (re-)download the model weights and configuration files and override the cached versions if they exists.

            proxies: (`optional`) dict, default None:
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g.: {'http': 'foo.bar:3128', 'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.
                The proxies are used on each request.

            output_loading_info: (`optional`) boolean:
                Set to ``True`` to also return a dictionnary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.

            kwargs: (`optional`) Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments:
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model. (e.g. ``output_attention=True``). Behave differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or automatically loaded:

                - If a configuration is provided with ``config``, ``**kwargs`` will be directly passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have already been done)
                - If a configuration is not provided, ``kwargs`` will be first passed to the configuration class initialization function (:func:`~pytorch_transformers.PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`). Each key of ``kwargs`` that corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the supplied ``kwargs`` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` function.

        Examples::

            model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')    # Download model and configuration from S3 and cache.
            model = BertModel.from_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')  # E.g. model was saved using `save_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')`
            model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', output_attention=True)  # Update configuration during loading
            assert model.config.output_attention == True
            # Loading from a TF checkpoint file instead of a PyTorch model (slower)
            config = BertConfig.from_json_file('./tf_model/my_tf_model_config.json')
            model = BertModel.from_pretrained('./tf_model/my_tf_checkpoint.ckpt.index', from_tf=True, config=config)
